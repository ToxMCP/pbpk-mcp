=== Use Case 7: Chlorpyrifos Risk Assessment (Proxy Method) ===

Goal: Assess exposure risk for Chlorpyrifos using the PBPK engine.
      (Using Acetaminophen model as a kinetic proxy for distribution)

[1] Hazard Identification (EPA CompTox Data)
    Chemical: Chlorpyrifos (DTXSID4020458)
    Neurotoxicity Threshold (Plasma Css): 0.0161 mg/L

[2] Loading Kinetic Model (Proxy)...

[3] Configuring Vulnerable Subject (Liver Volume 0.75L)...

[4] Running Exposure Simulation...

[5] Risk Characterization
    Simulated Plasma Cmax: 87.9349 mg/L
    Safety Threshold:      0.0161 mg/L
    Margin of Exposure (Ratio): 5461.8x Threshold

    CONCLUSION: EXPOSURE EXCEEDS THRESHOLD. RISK INDICATED.

    Brain Exposure: 28.1946 mg/L
    (Significant brain penetration confirmed)
